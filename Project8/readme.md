Create a palindrome creator application for making a longest possible palindrome out of given input string.
We can create palindrome by two ways:
1. By rearranging or removing characters ( i.e., we can rearrange aabbcc to abccba or we can remove any two characters out of l,e,x from alexa to make ala,aea, axa)
2. By selecting a palindrome substring ( i.e., we can remove k,ek to make kvivek to viv)
